  Web Development?</h1>
     <p>
          Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience. <br>

          Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use depends on the types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are working. <br>

          Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a great career option. It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a traditional university degree to become qualified. <br>

          <br> The field of web development is generally broken down into front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end (the server side). Let’s delve into the details.

  </h1>
     <p>
          A <strong> front-end</strong> dev takes care of layout, design and interactivity using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They take an idea from the drawing board and turn it into reality. <br>
         <br> The <strong> backend</strong> developer engineers what is going on behind the scenes. This is where the data is stored, and without this data, there would be no frontend. The backend of the web consists of the server that hosts the website, an application for running it and a database to contain the data.
